# MAS286_A3: UoS MAS286 Assignment 3 Code

Here are two **shiny** apps, **GDPvsH** and **GDPvsH_al**.

Difference: **GDPvsH** uses the package **ggpubr**, combining two plots into a single **ggplot2** object, in order to set the layout of the output.

While **GDPvsH_al** uses only the package **shiny**.

The size of plots in **GDPvsH_al** is larger.
